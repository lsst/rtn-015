\setDocAbstract{%
Leveraging the GPU with CUDA C/C++, the brighter-fatter effect (BFE) correction algorithm from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) Science Pipelines can be significantly optimized. BFE correction is among several other instrument signature removal (ISR) algorithms that are applied to astronomical images. BFE correction was a particularly good candidate for GPU optimization since it took up a majority of the ISR time (78.15% of the total ISR time). The BFE correction algorithm itself is highly parallelizable, particularly due to its use of convolutions and NumPy functions such as numpy.diff and numpy.gradient. Additionally, the algorithm is an iterative process, which offsets the time to perform memory transfers between the CPU (host) and GPU (device). The GPU implementation of the BFE correction algorithm achieved an average speed up of 10.95x over a CPU implementation using OpenCV C++.
